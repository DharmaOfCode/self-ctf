# CTF and Wargame Challanges

A collection of binaries I wrote myself for playing with reverse engineering tools.

## Challenges

*go-bin*: Can you access your metaverse secrets? This is a simple go binary to help getting used to reversing go binaries. It was compiled for Darwin only (will add additonal archs later). Run the binary to start a server running on `localhost:1984`, you can then connect to it with `nc localhost 1984`.
